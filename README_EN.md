# CAN-RS4  
Control DJI RS4 Gimbal via CAN Communication.

# DJI RS4 Gimbal CAN Control Project

This project enables CAN-based control of the DJI RS4 gimbal.  
It uses Python scripts and a SocketCAN environment to communicate with the gimbal.

---

## üìå Project Overview

- Controls the DJI RS4 gimbal using CAN communication  
- Analyzes the Lua script used in Mission Planner:  
  [`mount-djirs2-driver.lua`](https://github.com/ArduPilot/ardupilot/blob/master/libraries/AP_Scripting/drivers/mount-djirs2-driver.lua)  
- Controls gimbal angles using the `send_gimbal_angle()` Python function  
- The angle transition time is adjustable (default: 2 seconds)

| Item                  | Value                            |
|-----------------------|----------------------------------|
| CAN ID                | `0x223`                          |
| Transmission Speed    | `1 Mbps`                         |
| Error Detection       | DJI proprietary CRC16 / CRC32    |
| Data Transmission     | 8-byte segmented CAN frames      |

| Component                 | Description                                                        |
|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| USB-CAN Adapter          | **CANable Nano v1.0**                                               |
| Termination Resistors    | Two 120Œ© resistors                                                  |
| Custom Gimbal Connector  | **DIY connector required** (refer to schematic image above)        |
| Cable Connections        | Shared GND, CAN_H, CAN_L                                            |
| Operating System         | Linux (e.g., Ubuntu)                                                |

## üöÄ How to Run

1. Connect the CAN adapter to the Linux system and check connection using `lsusb`
2. Enable CAN interface at 1 Mbps:
   ```bash
   sudo ip link set can0 up type can bitrate 1000000
   ```
3. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python3 CAN_Send.py
   ```
